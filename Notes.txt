small world-spanning rpg/roguelike


Small world-map with each area having small platformery levels


Was the world always this small? I can't really remember.





Small grid based world. Roguelike, you move, enemies move, etc.
You can find knives/darts/something to throw at enemies. Maybe stun them, maybe kill them.
Enemies move around trying to get you.
You're trying to find... something. You don't know what it is.
Each time you reach the goal in the level, you wake up in a smaller world than before.
Eventually, you end up in a tiny world full of enemies you cannot escape, and lose.
However, if you found the secret things in the prior worlds, something good happens and you are free.
