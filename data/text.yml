- Strangeness
- Something's not right.
- Was the world always this small?
- ...it's hard to think clearly...
- Nowhere to go but forwards.
- What are these creatures, anyway?
- Where did they come from?
- What are they doing here?
- ... or have they always been here?
- ...
- Did anyone else survive?
- Was there never anyone\nelse to begin with?
- That can't be right. Am I just dreaming?
- ...was my past life the dream?
- ...or am <i>I<i> the dream?
- Whose dream am I?
- ...
- ... I'm lost.
