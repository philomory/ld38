- Something's not right.
- Was the world always this small?
- Something is missing.
- It's on the tip of my tongue...
- ...it's hard to think clearly.
- ...
- Gotta keep moving forward.

- What are these creatures, anyway?
- Where did they come from?
- What are they doing here?
- ... or have they always been here?
- ...
- Did anyone else survive?
- "Was there never anyone\nelse to begin with?"
- "That can't be right.\nAm I just dreaming?"
- ...was my past life the dream?
- ...or am <i>I<i> the dream?
- Whose dream am I?
- ...
- ... I'm lost.
