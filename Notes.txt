small world-spanning rpg/roguelike


Small world-map with each area having small platformery levels


Was the world always this small? I can't really remember.





Small grid based world. Roguelike, you move, enemies move, etc.
You can find knives/darts/something to throw at enemies. Maybe stun them, maybe kill them.
Enemies move around trying to get you.
You're trying to find... something. You don't know what it is.
Each time you reach the goal in the level, you wake up in a smaller world than before.
Eventually, you end up in a tiny world full of enemies you cannot escape, and lose.
However, if you found the secret things in the prior worlds, something good happens and you are free.





Ok, going to need a grid. Probably going to re-use CellGrid again.




New interactables:
* Portal - depending on portal offsets, can be used to desync
* Delay - Enemies get an extra move after you step on this; can be used to desync
* Doppel - Enemy who mirrors your movement; possibly literal mirror across an axis, possibly rotationally identical to you
* Seeker - Enemy who tries to move towards the player
* Respawn - Should enemies that get fried respawn in their start location? Can rock get fried?
* Pickup that lets you walk over a gap
* Pickup that lets you break down a wall
* Triggered object that explodes when touched by an enemy, stepped on by the player, or has a rock thrown at it. Can chain react, of course
* Bombs similar to above, but pushable? 
* Switches that can be triggered by thrown rocks?
* Conveyor belts?
* Probably not ice floors, but maybe?
* Beam and mirror puzzles?
* Crumbling floors?
